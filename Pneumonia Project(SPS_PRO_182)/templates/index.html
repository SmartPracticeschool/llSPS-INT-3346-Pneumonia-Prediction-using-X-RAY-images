<h2>PNEUMONIA PREDICTION USING X-RAY</h2>

<div>
    <p>A patient suffering from Pneumonia goes to the hospital to take an X-ray image waits for the doctor and then
     the doctor will check the X-ray then he decides whether the person has pneumonia or not. The results are not only
      concluded based on just seeing the X-ray images but furthermore, tests were conducted on the patient to verify the
       results of the doctor. The process is time-consuming and if the patient has severe pneumonia  or not he has to
        wait several days to get the test results. But in recent developments of the artificial intelligence and the
         computational powers of the computers have increased it helps in predicting pneumonia by just passing the
          X-ray image as an input to our model.</p>
